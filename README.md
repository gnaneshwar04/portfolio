Welcome to my personal portfolio! 👋

This website showcases my projects, skills, and ways to connect with me. It is built using basic web technologies like:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (planned)
- Responsive design (in progress)


## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure
- (Optional) `style.css` – CSS file for styling (if used separately)



## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add JavaScript interactivity
- Make the site fully responsive
- Add project links with GitHub repos
